Kerberos Android NDK Sample Application

This is a sample Android NDK application which acts as a simple GUI wrapper
around the MIT Kerberos kinit, klist, kvno, and kdestroy client 
applications as well as provides a Java GSS-API interface. The GSS-API
interface is a Java wrapper for the existing Kerberos GSS-API C-bindings and 
was created using SWIG. 

This package includes cross-compiled versions of the MIT Kerberos
libraries as well as the CyaSSL Embedded SSL Library. It should be 
helpful to Android developers who are interested in using the 
Kerberos libraries or the GSS-API interface in their own Android NDK 
Applications.

By default, this package uses pre-built static Kerberos and CyaSSL 
libraries, which are needed in order to be linked to the KerberosApp 
application's native library (libkerberosapp.so).

For detailed information on the Java GSS-API interface, please see the
GSSAPI_README file included in this project's root directory.

===========================================================================
REQUIREMENTS:

Before building or installing this package, you must have the Android SDK
and NDK installed and set up on your system. It is also helpful to have the
Android Emulator set up and configured with an Android platform greater
than or equal to version 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). For details on downloading and 
setting these up, please see the following links:

Android SDK:  http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
Android NDK:  http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Android Emulator:
https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html

===========================================================================
BUILDING:

To build and install this package, including Java GSS-API bindings, run
the following commands. If you would like to use the GSS-API example
client, please update your client and server settings in
./src/edu/mit/kerberos/KerberosAppActivity.java before building the project.

android update project -p . -s
swig -java -package edu.mit.kerberos -outdir ./src/edu/mit/kerberos
     -o ./jni/gsswrapper_wrap.c ./jni/gsswrapper.i
ndk-build
ant debug

If you want to rebuild the pre-built Kerberos libraries, please use the
android-config.sh shell script. This will allow the MIT Kerberos libraries
to be cross-compiled for the Android platform. More detailed instructions 
can be found in the script comments.

NOTE: The SWIG GSS-API wrapper code takes care of loading the shared
library using the System.loadLibrary(...) method. This means that you
don't have to call System.loadLibrary() from your Java application 
code, but you will need to verify the library name is correct in
gsswrapper.i before running the "swig", "ndk-build", and "ant debug"
commands.

===========================================================================
INSTALLING:

To install this package in a running Android emulator, run:

ant install

Before running the KerberosApp application, the user needs to install both
a Keytab file and a Kerberos configuration file. Reference the MIT Kerberos
documentation for guidelines for creating these files. Once created, they
can be installed using the adb push command, using:

adb push <local-file-path> <destination-file-path>

For example, to load a krb5.conf and krb5.keytab file from the current 
directory to an Android emulator under the /data/local/kerberos 
directory, run:

adb push krb5.conf /data/local/kerberos/
adb push krb5.keytab /data/local/kerberos/

The keytab file needs to contain an entry for the client principal (whose
TGT will be obtained by using the "kinit" button in the sample Application.
In order for the example client functionality to work, this same principal
must be entered in KerberosAppActivity.java as clientName.

NOTE: hosts file
----------------
If you need to edit the hosts file on the android emulator to accomidate for
KDC locations, use the following steps:

emulator -avd <name> -partition-size 128
adb remount
adb pull /system/etc/hosts ./
<< edit hosts file on local machine >>
adb push ./hosts /system/etc

===========================================================================
DEFAULT STORAGE LOCATIONS:

The following locations are the default paths used for the Kerberos
sample application.

Kerberos config file:   /data/local/kerberos/krb5.conf
Credentials cache:      /data/local/kerberos/ccache/krb5cc_<uid>
Keytab:                 /data/local/kerberos/krb5.keytab

The credentials cache location may be changed in KerberosAppActivity.java.
The Kerberos config file and keytab file locations may be changed by editing
the default locations in ./include/osconf.h when cross compiling the MIT 
kerberos libraries.
